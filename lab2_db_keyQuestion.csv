Cleaning the project fixes the problem, but it looks bad.  Can we kick off a rebuild after finishing the wizard?

EDIT: After going through the wizard several times - I think this is my largest gripe.  It really leaves Eclipse in a bad state.  Touching a file to kick off incremental does not fix it, only a project clean (which is not intuitive).  It feels from a user point of view that the wizard is broken.
